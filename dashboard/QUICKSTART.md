## Troubleshooting

### "streamlit: command not found" Error
This is a common PATH issue. Use one of these solutions:

1. **Use the Python launcher** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 launch_dashboard.py
   ```

2. **Use python -m streamlit**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Add to PATH** (if you want to use `streamlit` directly):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
   ```

### "Failed to load data"
- Ensure you're in the `dashboard` directory
- Check that `../output/` contains the required JSON files
- Verify file permissions

### "Module not found" errors
- Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you're using Python 3.7+

### Charts not displaying
- Refresh the browser page
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

## Data Files Required

The dashboard expects these files in the `../output/` directory:
- `gender_topic_sentiment_report.json`
- `enhanced_polarization_report.json`
- `speakers_with_embeddings.json`
- `transcription_with_timestamps.json`

## Need Help?

- Check the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Run `python3 test_data_loading.py` to diagnose data issues
- Use `python3 demo_features.py` to see all features
- Ensure your analysis pipeline has completed successfully
